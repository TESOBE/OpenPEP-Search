      <p class="search-info">This is dummy text. It is intended to be read but have no meaning. As a simulation of actual copy, using ordinary words with normal letter frequencies, it cannot deceive eye or brain. Dummy settings which use other languages or even gibberish to approximate text have the inherent disadvantage that they distract attention towards themselves. Simultext may be provided in any typeface, at whatever size and format is required.</p>
