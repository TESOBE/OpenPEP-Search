      <p>The Open PEPs Database is a free, online platform where users can search for or upload publicly available information on politically exposed persons (PEPs) from official and/or credible sources.
      This database follows the United Nations Convention Against Corruption’s (UNCAC) definition of politically exposed persons (PEPs) as cited below.</p>
      <p>Due to their roles in public administration, PEPs have a higher risk of becoming involved in corrupt activities. This is why financial institutions are required by international standards to carry out additional scrutiny on PEPs (this is known as enhanced due diligence). </p>
      <p>As well as being used by financial institutions, data on PEPs can be of value in other sectors, for example a) suppliers of company incorporation services, in order to determine if the ultimate beneficial owner of a registered company is a PEP; b) real estate vendors; c) vehicle dealerships and in general any sector in which the risk of customers attempting to realize transactions with proceeds of corruption is considered material.
      The information in this database is collected by registered contributors such as recognised civil society organisations.</p>

      <p>Definition of a public official in the United Nations Convention Against Corruption:<p>
      <p><i>“… (i) any person holding a legislative, executive, administrative or judicial office of a State Party, whether appointed or elected, whether permanent or temporary, whether paid or unpaid, irrespective of that person’s seniority; (ii) any other person who performs a public function, including for a public agency or public enterprise, or provides a public service, as defined in the domestic law of the State Party and as applied in the pertinent area of law of that State Party; </i></p>

      <p><i>
        (iii) any other person defined as a ‘public official’ in the domestic law of a State Party. However, for the purpose of some specific measures contained in chapter II of this Convention, ‘public official’ may mean any person who performs a public function or provides a public service as defined in the domestic law of the State Party and as applied in the pertinent area of law of that State Party.”</i></p>

      <p>This definition should be seen in conjunction with Article 52 (1) stating that <i>“[…] each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary, in accordance with its domestic law, to require financial institutions within its jurisdiction to verify the identity of customers, to take reasonable steps to determine the identity of beneficial owners of funds deposited into high-value accounts and to conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates.”</i></p>

      <p>Please note that at this pilot stage, Open PEP data does not cover family members and close associates of PEPs. </p>
